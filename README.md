<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Aisha Bakare! I have an analytical background in Biochemistry and a Master’s degree in Public Health and Epidemiology from the University of Illinois, Springfield. My strong foundation in the life sciences fuels my passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights.<br></br>
With expertise in data analysis and statistical evaluation, I am eager to apply my technical skills in data science as a data specialist. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends within complex datasets. Additionally, I have gained hands-on experience in laboratory techniques, data management, project management, and statistical analysis—all valuable assets for solving real-world problems using data.<br></br>
In my free time, I enjoy reading and exploring new data analysis tools and techniques. Whether working independently or collaborating with a team, I thrive on the challenge of discovering actionable insights and making data-driven decisions.

<Strong>Brief</Strong><br></br>
<p><Strong>Technology: </Strong>Microsoft Office Excel</p>
<p><Strong>Results:</Strong> The analysis showed a total of 36,738 vaccinations administered between January 1 and March 31, 2024. 
The COVID-19 vaccines (both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) accounted for the majority of vaccinations, comprising 39% and 26% respectively. Other vaccines included Pneumococcal (PREVNAR20), RSV (AREXVY), and Zoster (Shingrix), with lower percentages of total vaccinations.
From the results, the majority of vaccinations were administered via intramuscular (IM) injection, followed by subcutaneous (SC) and other routes. This indicates a preference for IM as the primary method for delivering vaccines, likely due to its effectiveness and common practice. The data suggests that vaccination strategies should continue to focus on IM routes for optimal coverage.

<strong>Patients Care Analysis & Report</strong>

<p><Strong>Objective:</Strong>This analysis aimed to provide insights into the monthly patient flow and financial aspects of care delivery for Rosemarie Hospital.</p>
<p><Strong>Technology: </Strong>Excel, Power BI</p>
<p><Strong>Results:</Strong> The analysis showed that Outpatient services were the most utilized (50.4%), followed by inpatient (24.9%) and emergency (24.7%). This could indicate a successful strategy in preventative care or management of patient conditions, potentially leading to lower rates of inpatient admissions over time. However, it also necessitates adequate outpatient facilities and staffing. The significant emergency service volume suggests a need for efficient emergency department operations and resource allocation.
Physician referrals (33.62%), self-referrals (33.16%), and emergency visits (33.22%) were relatively balanced as sources of patient admission. The high self-referral rate might suggest strong community awareness and trust in Rosemarie Hospital. The significant number of patients originating from the emergency department highlights its critical role as an entry point to the hospital.
A large number of emergency visits (around 3K) did not have a follow-up, while approximately 2K did. The lack of follow-up for a substantial portion of emergency patients could lead to poorer patient outcomes, increased readmission rates for unresolved issues, and potentially lower patient satisfaction. Investigating the reasons (e.g., nature of the emergency, discharge instructions, access to primary care) is crucial. 
A significant portion of services were paid (around 3K), but a considerable amount remained pending (just under 2K). A high number of pending payments can negatively impact the hospital's cash flow and financial stability. Efficient billing and collection processes are essential to minimize this. Understanding the reasons for pending payments (e.g., insurance claims processing delays, patient financial difficulties) can inform strategies for improvement.
Treatment costs were $2.63 million, medication costs were $546.04K, and there were 2507 follow-up visits. High treatment and medication costs necessitate careful cost management and efficiency measures without compromising patient care. The number of follow-up visits contributes to the overall revenue but also indicates the ongoing care needs of the patient population. Tracking these financial metrics over time is crucial for assessing the hospital's financial performance and sustainability.
